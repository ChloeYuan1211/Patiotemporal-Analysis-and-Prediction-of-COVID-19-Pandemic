        "In this part, I used methods such as autocorrelation analysis and density estimation to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns in the data. I explored information such as trends in epidemic transmission, high-risk areas, and spatiotemporal correlations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The results of autocorrelation analysis show the autocorrelation coefficients of the total population sequence in the epidemic data at different lag stages. The autocorrelation coefficient of lag 0 is 1, indicating a complete correlation between oneself and oneself. This is because the daily number of confirmed cases has the strongest correlation with oneself, which is a fundamental property of autocorrelation analysis. The autocorrelation coefficient of lag 1 is 0.852, indicating a strong positive correlation between the current number of confirmed cases and the number of confirmed cases from the previous day. This indicates that the number of confirmed cases on the previous day has a significant impact on the number of confirmed cases on that day. Similarly, as the number of lag periods increases, the autocorrelation coefficient gradually decreases, indicating that the correlation between the current number of confirmed cases and the number of confirmed cases at a longer time point in the past is becoming weaker. This autocorrelation analysis result indicates that there is a certain time correlation between the number of confirmed cases in the epidemic data, that is, the number of confirmed cases in the past period will have an impact on the current number of confirmed cases, but as the time interval increases, the correlation gradually weakens (shown in figure 1)"
